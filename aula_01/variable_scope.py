Variable Scope

There're two scope cases:

1 - Global Variables:
    - Global variables are recognized in all of program.
2 - Local Variables
    -Local variables are recognized only in the declared block, that is, your scope is limited in block that was declared

Python is a Dynamic Typing Language,that is, if a variable is declared, we don't put the data type. 
This type is inferred by assigning a value to the same.
